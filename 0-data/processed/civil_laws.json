Specific denial.\u20141[(1)] Every allegation of fact in the plaint, if not denied specifically or by \nnecessary implication, or stated to be not admitted in the pleading of the defendant, shall be taken to be \nadmitted except as against a person under disability: \nProvided that the Court may in its discretion require any fact so admitted to be proved otherwise than \nby such admission: \n*[Provided further that every allegation of fact in the plaint, if not denied in the manner provided \nunder Rule 3A of this Order, shall be taken to be admitted except as against a person under disability.] \n2[(2) Where the defendant has not filed a pleading, it shall be lawful for the court to pronounce \njudgment on the basis of the facts contained in the plaint, except as against a person under a disability, but \nthe Court may, in its discretion, require any such fact to be proved. \n(3) In exercising its discretion under the proviso to sub-rule (1) or under sub-rule (2), the Court shall \nhave due regard to the fact whether the defendant could have, or has, engaged a pleader. \n(4) Whenever a judgment is pronounced under this rule, a decree shall be drawn up in accordance \nwith such judgment and such decree shall bear the date on which the judgment was pronounced.] \nSTATE AMENDMENT \nJammu and Kashmir and Ladakh (UTs).\u2014 \nIn Rule 5, in sub-rule (1) after first proviso thereto, insert the following proviso, namely:- \n Provided further, that every allegation of fact in the plaint, if not denied in the manner provided \nunder Rue 3-A of this order, shall be taken to be admitted except as against a person under disability. \n[Vide the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Adaptation of Central Laws) Order, 2020, notification \nNo. S.O. 1123(E) dated (18-3-2020) and vide Union Territory of Ladakh Reorganisation (Adaptation of \nCentral Laws) Order, 2020, Notification No. S.O. 3774(E), dated (23-10-2020)]. \n6. Particulars of set-off to be given in written statement.\u2014(1) Where in a suit for the recovery of \nmoney the defendant claims to set-off against the plaintiff's demand any ascertained sum of money legally \nrecoverable by him from the plaintiff, not exceeding the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the Court, and \nboth parties fill the same character as they fill in the plaintiff's suit, the defendant may, at the first hearing of \nthe suit, but not afterwards unless permitted by the Court, presents a written statement containing the \nparticulars of the debt sought to be set-off. \n(2) Effect of set-off.\u2014The written statement shall have the same effect as a plaint in a cross-suit so as \nto enable the court to pronounce a final judgment in respect both of the original claim and of the set-off: \nbut this shall not affect the lien, upon the amount decreed, of any pleader in respect of the costs payable to \nhim under the decree. \n(3) The rules relating to a written statement by a defendant apply to a written statement in answer to a \nclaim of set-off. \nIllustrations \n(a) A bequeaths Rs. 2,000 to B and appoints C his executor and residuary legatee. B dies and D takes out administration \nto B's effects, C pays Rs, 1,000 as surety for D; then D sues C for the legacy. C cannot set-off the debt of Rs. 1,000 \nagainst the legacy, for neither C nor D fills the same character with respect to the legacy as they fill with respect to \nthe payment of the Rs. 1,000. \n(b) A dies intestate and in debt to B. C takes out administration to A\u2019s effects and B buys part of the effects from C. \nIn a suit for the purchase-money by C against B, the latter cannot set-off the debt against the price, for C fills \ntwo different characters, one as the vendor to B, in which he sues B, and the other as representative to A.  \n(c) A sues B on a bill of exchange. B alleges that A has wrongfully neglected to insure B's goods and is liable to him in \ncompensation which he claims to set-off. The amount not being ascertained cannot be set-off. \n                                                      \n1. Rule 5 renumbered as sub-rule (I) by Act 104 of 1976, s. 58 (w.e.f. 1-2-1977). \n2.

Shall be applicable to commercial disputes of a specified value by Act 4 of 2016, s. 16 and the Schedule (w.e.f. 23-10-2015).\n105 \n \n(d)  A sues B on a bill of exchange for Rs. 500. B holds a judgment against A for Rs. 1,000. The two claims being both definite \npecuniary demands may be set-off. \n(e) A sues B for compensation on account of trespass. B hold a promissory note for Rs. 1,000 from A and claims to set-off that \namount against any sum that A may recover in the suit. B may do so, for, as soon as A recovers, both sums are definite \npecuniary demands. \n(f) A and B sue C for Rs. 1,000. C cannot set-off a debt due to him by A alone. \n(g) A sues B and C for Rs. 1,000. B cannot set-off a debt due to him alone by A. \n(h) A owes the partnership firm of B and C Rs. 1,000. B dies, leaving C surviving. A sues C for a debt for Rs. 1,500 due in his \nseparate character. C may set-off the debt of Rs. 1,000. \n1[6A. Counter-claim by defendant.\u2014(1) A defendant in a suit may, in addition to his right of \npleading a set-off under rule 6, set up, by way of counter-claim against the claim of the plaintiff, any \nright or claim in respect of a cause of action accruing to the defendant against the plaintiff either before \nor after the filing of the suit but before the defendant has delivered his defence or before the time limited \nfor delivering his defence has expired, whether such counter-claim is in the nature of a claim for \ndamages or not: \nProvided that such counter-claim shall not exceed the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the \ncourt. \n(2) Such counter-claim shall have the same effect as a cross-suit so as to enable the Court to pro-\nnounce a final judgment in the same suit, both on the original claim and on the counter-claim. \n(3) The plaintiff shall be at liberty to file a written statement in answer to the counter-claim of the \ndefendant within such period as may be fixed by the court. \n(4) The counter-claim shall be treated as a plaint and governed by the rules applicable to plaints. \n6B. Counter-claim to be stated.\u2014 Where any defendant seeks to rely upon any ground as support-\ning a right of counter-claim, he shall, in his written statement, state specifically that he does so by way of \ncounter-claim. \n6C. Exclusion of counter-claim.\u2014Where a defendant sets up a counter-claim and the plaintiff con-\ntends that the claim thereby raised ought not to be disposed of by way of counter-claim but in an indepen-\ndent suit, the plaintiff may, at any time before issues are settled in relation to the counter-claim, apply to \nthe Court for an order that such counter-claim may be excluded, and the Court may, on the hearing of \nsuch application make such order as it thinks fit. \n6D. Effect of discontinuance of suit.\u2014 If in any case in which the defendant sets up a counterclaim, \nthe suit of the plaintiff is stayed, discontinued or dismissed, the counter-claim may nevertheless be \nproceeded with. \n6E. Default of plaintiff to reply to counter-claim.\u2014If the plaintiff makes default in putting in a \nreply to the counter-claim made by the defendant, the Court may pronounce judgment against the plaintiff \nin relation to the counter-claim made against him, or make such order in relation to the counter-claim as it \nthinks fit. \n6F. Relief to defendant where counter-claim succeeds.\u2014Where in any suit a set-off or counter-\nclaim is established as a defence against the plaintiff\u2019s claim and any balance is found due to the \nplaintiff or the defendant, as the case may be. the Court may give judgment to the party entitled to \nsuch balance. \n6G. Rules relating to written statement to apply.\u2014The rules relating to a written statement by a \ndefendant shall apply to a written statement filed in answer to a counter-claim.] \n7. Defence or set-off founded upon separate grounds.\u2014Where the defendant relies upon several \ndistinct grounds of defence or set-off  1[or counter-claim] founded upon separate and distinct facts, they \nshall be stated, as far as may be, separately and distinctly. \n8. New ground of defence.\u2014Any ground of defence which has arisen after the institution of the suit \nor the presentation of a written statement claiming a set-off 1[or counter-claim] may be raised by the \ndefendant or plaintiff, as the case may be, in his written statement. \n8A. [Duty of defendant to produce documents upon which relief is claimed by him.] omitted by Act  \n46 of 1999, s. 18 (w.e.f. 1-7-2002). \n2[9. Subsequent pleadings.\u2014No pleading subsequent to the written statement of a defendant other \nthan by way of defence to set-off or counter-claim shall be presented except by the leave of the Court \n                                                      \n1.
